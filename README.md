# PersonalizedCoupons
The purpose of this software is to be a learning experience for java swing/GUI development and the software lifecycle. The software is a take on a personalized coupon book that one might give to another for special occasions or as a gift for the holidays/anniversaries.

## Important notes for this project:
I am unfamiliar with python but following some tutorials and using familiar programming language paradigms, I will try my best to put together a working prototype.
